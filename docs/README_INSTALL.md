# Installation
There are two ways to install Integrity Shield.
- One YAML file for installation
- Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

### Prerequisite
Before installing Integrity Shield, [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) should be installed on the cluster.

## One YAML file for installation
You can install Integrity Shield the following two steps.
1. Install Integrity Shield Operator

This Operator will be installed in the "integrity-shield-operator-system" namespace.
```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stolostron/integrity-shield/master/integrity-shield-operator/deploy/integrity-shield-operator-latest.yaml
```

2. Install Integrity Shield CR

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stolostron/integrity-shield/master/integrity-shield-operator/config/samples/apis_v1_integrityshield.yaml -n integrity-shield-operator-system
```


## Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
1. Install Integrity Shield Operator using OLM

Please click the `Install` button in the upper right corner of this [document](https://operatorhub.io/operator/integrity-shield-operator) and follow the instructions.

2. Install Integrity Shield CR

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stolostron/integrity-shield/master/integrity-shield-operator/config/samples/apis_v1_integrityshield.yaml -n integrity-shield-operator-system
```


## Verify installation
To verify that installation was completed successfully,
run the following command.
The following three pods will be installed with default CR.
```
$ kubectl get pod -n integrity-shield-operator-system                                                                                                                  
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
