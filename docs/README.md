# Integrity Enforcer
   
## Integrity Enforcer (IE)
Integrity Enforcer is a tool for built-in preventive integrity control for regulated cloud workloads. It includes signature based configuration drift prevention based on [Admission Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) on Kubernetes cluster.

Integrity Enforcer's capabilities are 

- Allow to deploy authorized application pakcages only
- Allow to use signed deployment params only
- Zero-drift in resource configuration unless whitelisted
- Perform all integrity verification on cluster (admission controller, not in client side)
- Handle variations in application packaging and deployment (Helm /Operator /YAML / OLM Channel) with no modification in app installer
